and make the code more readable. It mainly includes two parts: basic reading and writing tools and data processing
functions commonly used in machine learning/deep learning.

## Development Guide

- `import` op is placed in utils/package.py

- `paddle`, `ltp`, etc. import time is too long and requires other import methods:
  ```python
  class STEM(object):
      from ltp import LTP
  
      def __init__(self, IPT_MODEL_PATH):
          self.ltp = LTP(IPT_MODEL_PATH)
  ```

## Development philosophy

Write a function once, never write it twice!

## Emample

```python
import nlpertools

a = nlpertools.readtxt_list_all_strip('res.txt')
# 或
b = nlpertools.io.file.readtxt_list_all_strip('res.txt')
```
