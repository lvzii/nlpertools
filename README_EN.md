# Introduction

This is a package of functions commonly used by NLP/data workers, which can simplify some reading and writing operations
and make the code more readable. It mainly includes two parts: basic reading and writing tools and data processing
functions commonly used in machine learning/deep learning.

What problem does it solve:

- Many functions are hard to remember, and every time you need to search or ask a large model, e.g., pandas sorting.
- When practicing coding problems, tree structure problems are hard to debug.

# Most commonly used/favorite features (usage examples)

```python
# Read txt, json files
import nlpertools

txt_data = nlpertools.readtxt_list_all_strip('res.txt')
json_data = nlpertools.load_from_json('res.json')
```

```bash
## git, very useful when github connection is unstable
ncli git pull

# Generate real-time key for pypi two-factor authentication (need to provide key)
ncli --get_2fa --get_2fa_key your_key
```

# 


# Install

Install the latest release version

```bash
pip install nlpertools
```

üì¢[ Recommend ] Install the latest git version
```

## Development Guide

- `import` op is placed in utils/package.py

- `paddle`, `ltp`, etc. import time is too long and requires other import methods:
  ```python
  class STEM(object):
      from ltp import LTP
  
      def __init__(self, IPT_MODEL_PATH):
          self.ltp = LTP(IPT_MODEL_PATH)
  ```
    According to the assessment by `pyinstrument`, packages that exceed 1 second will adopt this method.

## Development philosophy

Write a function once, never write it twice!
